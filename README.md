1. Run `vagrant up` from the same directory as the Vagrantfile in this repository.
1. SSH into the VM with: `vagrant ssh`
1. Run tests with `molecule`.

### Testing with Docker and molecule

```bash
cd /example-ansible-role
molecule test
```

See `molecule` for more information including a full list of available commands.

### interactive debugging

You can use log into a docker image created by molecule for interactive testing with the below commands.

```bash
cd /example-ansible-role
molecule converge
# Ubuntu
docker exec -it ubuntu /bin/bash
# CentOS
docker exec -it centos /bin/bash
```
